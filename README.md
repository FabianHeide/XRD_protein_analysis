# Analysis of XRD models for the Human Proteasome

This is an exploratory analysis project of the currently solved (Jan 2023) XRD protein structures for the human 
species. The raw datasets were pulled from the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/). The aim is to clean 
the data, calculate a few interesting protein properties and continue into an exploratory analysis on the currently 
available protein models.


Note: I am actively working on this project. If you have any comments or suggestions, do not <i>hesitate</i> to contact 
me. This includes inquiries on the written code and any suggestions for potential protein analyses.
